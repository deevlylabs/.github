# Deevly Labs

Execution & Governance Infrastructure for AI-Native Product Development.

---

## What We Build

Deevly Labs develops structured systems that transform ideas into deterministic architecture.

We operate on two foundational layers:

- **AI CTO Engine** — Deterministic architecture generation
- **INTENT** — Architectural governance runtime

We do not generate code.

We generate and enforce the systems that make AI generate correct code.

## Core Principles

Structure before execution.  
Architecture before automation.  
Governance before scale.

---

## Focus Areas

- AI-native system design
- Domain-driven architecture
- Deterministic execution graphs
- Governance for AI agents
- Enterprise-grade architectural control

---

## Vision

To become the architectural control plane for AI-driven software systems.
